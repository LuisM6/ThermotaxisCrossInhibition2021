Data Collection:

The thermotaxis data was collected in the thermotaxis behavior rig described in Methods, using the control strategy of Supplementary Fig. 8.

The optogenetics data was collected in the optogenetics rig described in Methods, and in Hernandez-Nunez, L., Belina, J., Klein, M., Si, G., Claus, L., Carlson, J.R. and Samuel, A.D., 2015. Reverse-correlation analysis of navigation dynamics in Drosophila larva using optogenetics. Elife, 4, p.e06225.

The movies were transformed in larval coordinates and contours using MAGAT Analyzer (https://github.com/samuellab/MAGATAnalyzer). 

The turning events were detected using code from Hernandez-Nunez, L., Belina, J., Klein, M., Si, G., Claus, L., Carlson, J.R. and Samuel, A.D., 2015. Reverse-correlation analysis of navigation dynamics in Drosophila larva using optogenetics. Elife, 4, p.e06225.

In the Thermotaxis folder the processed data can be visualized running the Script_1_Visualize_processed_data.m script in Matlab 2016b or later.

In the Optogenetics folder the processed data can be visualized running the Script_1_Visualize_processed_data.m script in Matlab 2016b or later.
